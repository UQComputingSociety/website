### Google Calendar API Key

The /events calendar uses FullCalendar.js and fetches events from Google Calendar. To do this, it needs a Google API key. Currently, the production key is specified in [events/\_index.html](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/website/blob/master/content/events/_index.html) but you will need your own key to test locally.

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard. 
2. If you haven't done so already, sign up with a Google account and create a new project. (UQCS committee can sign in with the Google account and use the "UQCS Website Calendar" project.)
3. If you created a new project, enable the Google Calendar API from within APIs & Services &rarr; Library.
4. Go to APIs & Services &rarr; Credentials and create new credentials. This page also shows existing API keys.
5. Copy the key use it where needed. Optionally, you can restrict this key to specific websites and APIs.
