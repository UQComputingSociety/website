dollars (not to mention bragging rights)!</p><h5>$500 - Best Overall Runner Up Project</h5><p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $500.</p><h5>$200 - Best Newcomer Project</h5><p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any
discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $200 to distribute between from themselves.</p><h5>$200 - People's Choice</h5><p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite
project, the project with the most votes will take home 200 big ones.</p><h5>$200 - Best Philanthropic Project</h5><p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic organisation or
addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $200 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).</p><h5>$100 - Best Designed Project</h5><p>The creator(s) of the project demonstrating the coolest visual design will take home their choice of $100
to spend on turtlenecks or a pirated PDF copy of Banksy's art book Wall and Piece.</p><h5>$100 - Most Masochistic Project</h5><p>The project that caused the most pain for its creators will earn them $100. It's not enough to make up
for a weekend of self-inflicted misery, but it helps.</p><h5>$100 - Best Hardware Project</h5><p>Hardware projects are hard, it's in the name. Here's $100 for having the best one.</p><h5>$100 - Best Interdisciplinary Project</h5><p>UQCS likes to mix things up. The best project demonstrating skills or solving problems from other
