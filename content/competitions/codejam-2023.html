        <div class="content">

            <p>The UQCS CodeJam, our semester 1 flagship event, is an individual competitive programming competition
                designed to put the programming and problem solving abilities of students of all years to the test.
                You'll be given a list of questions to solve, each varying in difficulty and style, with harder
                questions earning more points. The questions use knowledge from a wide range of disciplines but can
                all be solved with the help of code.
            </p>
            <p>It's a fun challenge to work through the questions, and getting experience with these styles of
                questions is especially useful as they are often asked by employers in technical interviews. The
                highest scoring competitors will be taking home some sweet prizes, courtesy of our sponsor for the
                event, <a href="https://www.imc.com/ap/">IMC Trading</a>! IMC are one of the world's most active proprietary
                trading firms and a key market maker in various products listed on exchanges throughout the world.
                They'll help support your journey and also provide you with some amazing networking opportunities!
            </p>
            <p>Keep reading to find out more about the competition and what to expect. If you have any more questions,
                you can reach out at any of our social media pages or via our lovely
                <a href="https://discord.uqcs.org">Discord community</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>So, how does it all work?</h3>
            <p>The UQCS CodeJam is a programming competition hosted online through
                <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>. You can code in virtually any language (see
                <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/environment">competition environment</a>).
                Once you’ve written your code, it’s executed online against a number of test cases. </p>
            <p>Tests will cover basic scenarios as well as larger and more complex cases to ensure your algorithm is
                efficient and reliable. Points are awarded for the number of tests you pass and are also based on the
                difficulty of the question.</p>
            <p>There will be a leaderboard of competitors throughout the event for you to track number of points
                scored. The top scorers by the end of the day, as mentioned, will earn prizes!</p>

            <h3>How can I prepare?</h3>
            <p>You'll need a HackerRank account to compete; you can sign up
                <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">here</a>. You don’t need to do special practice or
                preparation, just come well-rested and ready to problem solve! If you'd like, you can try some practice
                questions on HackerRank to get familiar with the interface and style of questions. If you've never used
                HackerRank before, not to worry! We will be going through a short demo of how it works at the start of
                CodeJam. You can also sign up to the competition on HackerRank in advance of the day:

            <h3>What do I do on the day?</h3>

                Advanced Engineering Building, room 49-301, but you can participate from anywhere. However, you must be competing
                in-person to be eligible for prizes. You can join in at any time but the more time you spend, the better your
                chances are of winning prizes!
            </p>
            <p>We'll also have free lunch on the day too, so be sure not to miss out!</p>
            <p>We’ll post updates and reminders throughout the day on our <a href="http://discord.uqcs.org/">Discord
                    server</a>.
                Both the event kickoff and presentation of prizes will be live streamed on our
                <a href="https://link.uqcs.org/youtube">YouTube channel</a>, at the start and end of
                the day, respectively. The actual coding competition will be hosted on HackerRank.
            </p>
