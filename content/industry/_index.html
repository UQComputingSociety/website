        <div class="content">
            <p>UQCS is supported by a number of industry partners every year, ranging from Brisbane startups to large multinational companies in a wide range of industries including technology, trading, consulting and more.</p>
                
            <p> Sponsoring UQCS has a number of benefits for both our partners and UQCS. It enables us to have higher quality events as we put essentially all of our resources back into the community and its education and development, with the majority of our money spent catering every event we host. For partners, it means direct access to potential interns, graduates and employees from our talented community. In addition, association with UQCS broadcasts your presence and dedication into innovation, not just to UQ students, but to the wider Brisbane tech community, including UQCS' vast alumni network.</p>
            
            <p>UQCS has a range of different sponsorship tiers that companies can subscribe to based on their needs. If you're interested in helping to cultivate the next generation of innovators, send us an email at <a href="mailto:contact@uqcs.org.au">contact@uqcs.org.au</a>!</p>
