<h1 class="page-heading">About the Hackathon</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Hackathon is the flagship event of the UQ Computing Society. It was to be first run in 2014, following significant interest from members over the past few years. This year will be our 2nd Hackathon, after a huge amount of positive feedback from our 2014 participants.</p>

<p>Teams will compete across the weekend of 1-2 August to develop an application, before entering them in one or more categories for judging. Teams may like to develop a game, a new smartphone app to help students, or use an existing dataset and turn it into an easier to use format. The best thing about Hackathon is that you get to do whatever you want, to show of your design and/or coding ability.</p>

<p>A number of mentors will be on hand throughout the weekend to assist with the development process. These will include students and industry representatives, knowledgable in many different areas. </p>

<p>More importantly, we will be have plenty of lollies and chips available during the day, to make sure you are fuelled for the task ahead. Not to mention the end of competition dinner -  a great way to wind down with other participants at the end of an intense weekend!</p>

<p>A number of prize categories will be available for the competition. These and other details will be announced closer to the date.</p>
