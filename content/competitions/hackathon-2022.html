            </p>

            <h3>Prizes</h3>

            <p>We'll have <b>$5500</b> in prizes up for grabs across ten categories:</p>

            <h5>$2000 - Best Overall</h5>
            <p>The creators of the best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home a whopping $2000
                dollars (not to mention bragging rights)! This prize is proudly sponsored by TechnologyOne.
            </p>

            <h5>$1000 - Best Overall Runner Up</h5>
            <p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $1000!
            </p>

            <h5>$500 - Best First-Years</h5>
            <p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $500 to distribute between themselves.
            <br />
            Note: for any ambiguous cases, the executive committee will determine team eligibility for this prize on presentation day.
            </p>

            <h5>$500 - People's Choice</h5>
            <p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite project, the project with the most votes will take home 500 big ones.
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Interdisciplinary Project</h5>
            <p>UQCS likes to mix things up. The best project demonstrating skills or solving problems from other disciplines (hardware, science, math, and dare we say it... humanities) will be awarded $250 cash.
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Design</h5>
            <p>The creator(s) of the project demonstrating the coolest visual design will take home their choice of $250 to spend on turtlenecks or a pirated PDF copy of Banksy's art book Wall and Piece.
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Game</h5>
            <p>Be it a game or a gaming related project there's $250 in it for the gamers as well. May the brightest mechanical keyboard win!
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Community Project</h5>
            <p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic or community organisation, or addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $250 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Presentation</h5>
            <p>While the project is important, so is the presentation. Why not ditch the slide deck for something with a bit more pizzazz, and win yourself $250?
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Most Masochistic</h5>
            <p>The project that caused the most pain for its creators will earn them $250. It's not enough to make up for a weekend of self-inflicted misery, but it helps.
            </p>
