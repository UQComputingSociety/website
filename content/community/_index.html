        <h1 class="title is-3">UQCS Community</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>We engage the community in a variety of different ways, through social gatherings, online platforms and 
                educational talks.
                In the past, we've run Games, Jackbox, Trivia and Movie Nights, BBQs, study sessions, end-of-semester
                drinks, and workshops; we also frequently collaborate with other tech and related interests societies,
                both in and out of UQ.</p>
            <p>We have an extremely active <a href="https://discord.uqcs.org/">Discord community</a> comprised of current 
                students, alumni, and other people in the Brisbane tech community.</p>
            <p>By providing mentors, advertisement, and helping with infrastructure, we support workshops held by 
                <a href="https://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a> (a group photo of 
                which is pictured below!).</p>

            <h3> How can I get involved?</h3>
            <p>The best way to get involved is attending our twice-weekly events and sticking around after the presentation
                to talk to other members and indulge in some free pizza. Joining our 
                <a href="https://discord.uqcs.org/">Discord server</a>, finding channels you’re interested in, asking 
                questions and sharing your opinions is another great way of getting to know the rest of UQCS’ members and 
                enhancing your university experience.</p>
            <p>UQCS is made up of a management committee of around a dozen people, composed of the President, Secretary
                and Treasurer, and the remaining members being part of the general committee. The management committee
                is elected towards the end of each year at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). </p>
            <p>If you're a student at UQ and a member of UQCS, regardless of what you study or what year you're in, 
                you're eligible to run for one of the committee positions, and we strongly encourage you to! There are
                also subcommittees that are formed at the discretion of the management committee which help in running 
                of the club.</p>
            <p>When opportunities to join the committee/subcommittee come up, they'll be widely advertised on UQCS’s 
                social media and in the weekly newsletters we send out to our members (so stay in touch!). 
                All of this is not a comprehensive list to get involved in UQCS by any means; if you would like to be 
                involved in the running of the club, reach out to one of our <a href="{{< relURL "/about/" >}}">friendly 
                committee members</a>.</p>

            <h4>Giving talks</h4>
            <p>Another great way to get involved is to <i>give</i> a talk at a UQCS event. Previous talks have ranged from
                <a href="https://youtu.be/BeJ6UD1ahpM">speech sythesis</a> to an intro to the 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/gw1xcxtsBpw">Rust programming language</a> to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/MKLLOxb2nmI">property-based testing</a>.
                If you'd be interested in giving a talk at UQCS,
