            <p>The UQCS CodeJam is an individual competitive programming competition. You get a list of questions to
                solve varying
                in difficulty, with harder questions gaining more points. The questions use knowledge from a wide range
                of fields but all can be solved with the help of code.</p>
            <p>It’s a fun challenge to get experience in these styles of questions, which are often asked by employers
                in technical interviews.</p>
            <p>Keep reading to find out more about the competition and what to expect. If you have any questions, reach
                out to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/659245534649313/">Facebook event</a> or <a
                    href="http://slack.uqcs.org/">Slack community</a>.</p>

            <h3>So how does it all work?</h3>
            <p>The CodeJam is hosted online through HackerRank. You can code in virtually any language (see <a
                    href="https://www.hackerrank.com/environment">competition environment</a>). Once you’ve written your
                code, it’s executed online against a number of test cases. </p>
            <p>Tests will cover basic scenarios as well as larger and more complex cases, to ensure your algorithm is
                efficient and reliable. Points are awarded for the number of tests you pass and the question’s
                difficulty.</p>
            <p>There will be a leaderboard of competitors based on points scored. The top scorers will get prizes!</p>


            <h3>How can I get ready?</h3>
            <p>You will need a HackerRank account to compete, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">sign up here</a>.
                You don’t need to do special practice or
                preparation, just come well-rested and ready to think!</p>
            <p>To get familiar with the HackerRank interface and styles of questions, you can try some practice
                questions on HackerRank.
            </p>

            <h3>What do I do on the day?</h3>
            <p>The CodeJam will run from 10am – 3:30pm on Saturday 28th March. You can join in anytime but the more time
                you spend, the better your chances of winning prizes! </p>
            <p>We’ll post updates and reminders throughout the day on our <a href="http://slack.uqcs.org/">Slack
                    chat</a>.
                Presentations and prizes will be live streamed on our <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/c/UQComputingSociety">YouTube</a>, at the start and end of the day.
                The actual coding competition will be hosted on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>.
