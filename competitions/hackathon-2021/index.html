Otherwise, tickets are $15 for students
and $20 for non-students (non-students are not eligible for prizes). As usual, we
will be supplying breakfast, lunch and dinner during the Hackathon too, so make sure to grab your tickets so
we can know how many people to cater for. See you there!</p><h3>Prizes</h3><p>We'll have <b>$2500</b> in prizes up for grabs across ten categories:</p><h5>$1000 - Best Overall</h5><p>The creators of the best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home a whopping $1000
dollars (not to mention bragging rights)! This prize is proudly sponsored by TechnologyOne.</p><h5>$500 - Best Overall Runner Up</h5><p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $500.</p><h5>$200 - Best Newcomers</h5><p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any
discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $200 to distribute between themselves.</p><h5>$200 - People's Choice</h5><p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite
project, the project with the most votes will take home 200 big ones.</p><h5>$100 - Best Interdisciplinary Project</h5><p>UQCS likes to mix things up. The best project demonstrating skills or solving problems from other
disciplines (hardware, science, math, and dare we say it... humanities) will be eligible for $100 cash.</p><h5>$100 - Best Design</h5><p>The creator(s) of the project demonstrating the coolest visual design will take home their choice of $100
to spend on turtlenecks or a pirated PDF copy of Banksy's art book Wall and Piece.</p><h5>$100 - Best Game</h5><p>Be it a game or a gaming related project there's $100 in it for the gamers as well. May the brightest mechanical keyboard win!</p><h5>$100 - Best Community Project</h5><p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic or community organisation, or
addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $100 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).</p><h5>$100 - Best Presentation</h5><p>While the project is import, so is the presentation. Why not ditch the slide deck for something with a bit more pizzazz.</p><h5>$100 - Most Masochistic</h5><p>The project that caused the most pain for its creators will earn them $100. It's not enough to make up
for a weekend of self-inflicted misery, but it helps.</p><h4>Rules</h4><p>There are a few rules you'll need to follow to be eligible for prizes:<ul><li>Teams must use some form of version control, in a new repository.</li><li>Projects cannot be started early.</li><li>Teams must consist of only students (from a university in QLD).</li><li>Prize winners must be uploaded to the UQCS Showcase before payout.</li></ul></p></div></section></div></div><footer class="footer uqcs-background is-dark"><div class="has-text-white footer-info columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8-desktop is-10-tablet"><div class=level><div class=level-left><div class=level-item><div><img src=/img/logo/logo-long-white.svg alt="UQ Computing Society Logo" class=image style=display:block;height:100px;width:256px><div class=mt-2>&copy; UQ Computing Society 2024</div><div>üëã Hello from Brisbane/Meanjin</div></div></div></div><div class="level-right is-hidden-mobile"><div class=level-item><ul><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/about>About</a></li><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/events>Events</a></li><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/connect>Connect</a></li><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/showcase>Showcase</a></li></ul></div><div class="level-item pl-6"><ul><li class=footer-link><a href=https://join.uqcs.org>Join UQCS</a></li><li class=footer-link><a href=https://discord.uqcs.org>Discord</a></li><li class=footer-link><a href=https://github.com/uqcomputingsociety/design>Design
