            <p>Howdy, y'all! We're happy to announce our biggest event of the year, the UQCS Hackathon, will be on
                <b>October 16th to 18th</b> in Room 301 of the Advanced Engineering Building.</p>

                <p>
                    Form a team on Friday night, then spend two days building something cool &mdash; a game, a website, hardware, 
                    the sky's the limit. On Sunday, teams will present what they've done, with $2500 in prizes up for grabs! 
                    And don't worry about food for the weekend; we'll be supplying breakfast, lunch and dinner each day.
                </p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Projects</h3>

            <h3>Prizes</h3>

            <p>We'll have <b>$2500</b> in prizes up for grabs across nine categories:</p>

            <h5>$1000 - Best Overall Project</h5>
            <p>The creators of the best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home a whopping $1000
                dollars (not to mention bragging rights)!
            </p>

            <h5>$500 - Best Overall Runner Up Project</h5>
            <p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $500.
            </p>

            <h5>$200 - Best Newcomer Project</h5>
            <p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any
                discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $200 to distribute between from themselves.
            </p>

            <h5>$200 - People's Choice</h5>
            <p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite
                project, the project with the most votes will take home 200 big ones.
            </p>

            <h5>$200 - Best Philanthropic Project</h5>
            <p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic organisation or
                addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $200 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).
