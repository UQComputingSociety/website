                Bring your creativity, friends, and coding skills for a weekend filled with innovation and excitement! Get ready for UQCS's biggest event of the year: Hackathon! The goal of hackathon is to build something amazing over the weekend, whether it's games, websites, apps, hardware, or more. Free meals are provided throughout the event, and you can stay overnight at UQ to code uninterrupted through the night.
			</p>

			<p>
                Everyone is welcome, regardless of your year or experience level, and its not necessary to have a team beforehand. If you’re new to hackathons, don’t worry—we will be hosting a talk before the hackathon weekend to clear up any confusion and give you tips and tricks to help you enjoy your hackathon experience! For inspiration, check out some past projects in <a href="/showcase/">our showcase</a>.

            <p>
                Early bird student tickets are just $30 (or $50 including a limited edition t-shirt that you can't get anywhere else). Tickets are $40 for students and $45 for non-students (non-students are not eligible for prizes).

            <h3>Prizes</h3>

            <p>More details about the prizes are coming soon. Check out the prizes from <a href="/competitions/hackathon-2023/">last year</a> to get a feel of what might be on offer.</p>
            
            <h4>Rules</h4>
            <p>There are a few rules you'll need to follow to be eligible for prizes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Teams must use some form of version control, in a new repository. If your project doesn't lend itself to being managed by version control (e.g. hardware), case-by-case considerations might be made.</li>
                    <li>Projects cannot be started early.</li>
                    <li>Teams must consist of <i>current</i> students from a university in Queensland, and team members must be UQCS members (you can join right <a href="https://join.uqcs.org" target="_blank">here</a> on the UQCS website!).</li>
                    <li>Prize winners must be uploaded to the UQCS Showcase before payout.</li>
                </ul>
            If your team isn't eligible to win prizes, you are still welcome to come along and participate!
