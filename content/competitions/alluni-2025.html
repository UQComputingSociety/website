                AllUni is an inter-university competitive programming competition for students across Australia and New Zealand! Create teams of up to three students to compete in an ICPC-style contest for the chance to win a variety of prizes, ranging from merchandise to a prize pool of $5000!
			</p>
            <p>
                Sign-up spots are limited, so we encourage you to register as early as possible.
            </p>
			<p>
                Whether you're experienced or just starting out in the world of competitive programming, all skill levels are welcomed and encouraged. Choose between competing in Division A, designed for experienced programmers with difficulty comparable to SPAR competitions. Otherwise, beginners can compete in Division B, featuring easier Leetcode-style questions.
