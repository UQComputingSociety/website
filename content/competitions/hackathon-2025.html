			<p>
                Get ready for UQCS’s biggest event of the year! Our very own Hackathon! Bring your coding skills and enthusiasm for three action-packed days of building, experimenting, and having fun. This hackathon is your chance to bring a project to life, whether it's games, websites, apps, hardware, or more.
			</p>

			<p>
                Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level, degree, or background! It’s totally fine if you don’t have a team yet as we will have a team formation session on the first day! If this is your first hackathon, no stress. We'll be running a ‘How-To Hackathon’ Talk on August 14 at 5PM in Hawken Engineering Building (50-N201) to walk you through what to expect, share helpful tips, and help set you up for success. For inspiration, check out some past projects in <a href="/showcase/">our showcase</a>.
