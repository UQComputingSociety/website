# Contributing

The UQCS site is a place to show off both the club itself, and the work its members. You can contribute ideas, bugs or suggestions by clicking the Issues tab above and creating a new issue.

You can contribute code by forking the repository, making your changes and creating a pull request. It's encouraged to create an issue for the changes you plan on making in your pull request and you should mention the IDs of any issues you work on in your pull request description.

Want help with creating a pull request? No problem!
Email us at contact@uqcs.org for help, or jump onto [Discord](https://discord.uqcs.org/) and ask in #projects for advice.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## The Contribution Process

1. Find an issue that you want to take on and [assign yourself to it](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users), or [create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) for the work you are about to do.
2. Create a branch to begin work on either using the [GitHub UI](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository), or via your [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
3. Checkout the branch locally and work on your issue.
4. When you are finished on your feature/issue, push it to the remote repository and [create your pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
5. [Request a review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) from one of the reviewers listed in the reviewers section of this document.
6. When your pull request is reviewed and approved, click `Squash and Merge`, clear the commits from below the merge title, then confirm.

If the steps above are unclear, jump onto [Discord](https://discord.uqcs.org/) and ask in #projects for advice.
