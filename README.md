### Getting Setup

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (make sure to get the extended version).
3. Open your preferred terminal.
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/website.git`
5. Run `cd website`
6. Run `hugo server -D`
7. Open your preferred browser.
8. Navigate to http://localhost:1313/

##### WSL
A couple extra steps are needed for running hugo on WSL. Do steps 1-5, then:

6. In a windows terminal, use `wsl -t $name` to terminate any WSL instances except the one you want to run hugo on.
7. Run `wsl hostname -I` to find the IP address of that WSL instance.
8. Run `hugo server -D --bind $ip --baseURL=$ip` instead of just `hugo server -D`
9. Open your preferred browser.
10. Navigate to http://$ip:1313/

### Showcasing Your Project

Have you built something cool you want to show off to the world? It's easy to publish your project to the [UQCS Showcase](https://uqcs.org/showcase/).

1. Fork this repository so you can make changes.
2. Follow the "Getting Setup" instructions above, replacing the URL with your fork's URL.
2. Add your project to [content/showcase/_index.html](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/website/blob/master/content/showcase/_index.html) by copying the format of an existing `showcase-item`. New projects should be added to the top.
3. Modify the `caption` text with a short blurb for your project. If you want to, you can use basic HTML in this field.
4. Add an image by adding it to the static/img/media/showcase/ folder then specifying the `src` attribute. Images should be at least 1000&times;750 (larger images with the same aspect ratio are also fine).
5. Link your project's GitHub repository or website using the `link` attribute.
6. Preview the showcase page at http://localhost:1313/showcase/ and make sure you're happy with how it looks.
7. Create a pull request by following the steps at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (creating a new issue isn't required for showcase items).
8. Once merged, you should be able to see your project at https://uqcs.org/showcase/!

### Google Calendar API Key

The /events calendar uses FullCalendar.js and fetches events from Google Calendar. To do this, it needs a Google API key. Currently, the production key is specified in [events/\_index.html](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/website/blob/master/content/events/_index.html) but you will need your own key to test locally.

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard. 
2. If you haven't done so already, sign up with a Google account and create a new project. (UQCS committee can sign in with the Google account and use the "UQCS Website Calendar" project.)
3. If you created a new project, enable the Google Calendar API from within APIs & Services &rarr; Library.
4. Go to APIs & Services &rarr; Credentials and create new credentials. This page also shows existing API keys.
5. Copy the key use it where needed. Optionally, you can restrict this key to specific websites and APIs.
