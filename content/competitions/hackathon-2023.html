			<p>
                Get ready for UQCS's biggest event of the year: Hackathon! Bring your ideas, teammates and coding passion to hack it out over the weekend. This year we will have seven meals over the course of the weekend and the ability to stay overnight at UQ so that you can code deep into the night uninterrupted.
			</p>

			<p>
                The aim of the hackathon is to build something within the weekend. We have seen games, websites, desktop applications, hardware and robots, but you are free to make anything that you can think of (a showcase of past projects can be seen <a href="/showcase/">here</a>). All years and levels are experience are welcome, whether you are a curious newcomer or a seasoned hacker. If you've never been to a hackathon before, we will also be hosting a talk on Thursday before Hackathon for some tips and tricks. Also, don't worry if you don't have a team formed beforehand; we will help connect you with other students or find teams that are missing important roles.

            <h3>Prizes</h3>

            <h5>$2000 - Best Overall</h5>
            <p>The creators of the best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home a whopping $2000
                dollars (not to mention bragging rights)! This prize is proudly sponsored by TechnologyOne.
            </p>

            <h5>$1000 - Best Overall Runner Up</h5>
            <p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $1000!
            </p>

            <h5>$500 - Best First-Years</h5>
            <p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $500 to distribute between themselves.
            <br />
            Note: for any ambiguous cases, the executive committee will determine team eligibility for this prize on presentation day.
            </p>

            <h5>$500 - People's Choice</h5>
            <p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite project, the project with the most votes will take home 500 big ones.
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Interdisciplinary Project</h5>
            <p>UQCS likes to mix things up. The best project demonstrating skills or solving problems from other disciplines (hardware, science, math, and dare we say it... humanities) will be awarded $250 cash.
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Design</h5>
            <p>The creator(s) of the project demonstrating the coolest visual design will take home their choice of $250 to spend on turtlenecks or a pirated PDF copy of Banksy's art book Wall and Piece.
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Game</h5>
            <p>Be it a game or a gaming related project there's $250 in it for the gamers as well. May the brightest mechanical keyboard win!
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Community Project</h5>
            <p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic or community organisation, or addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $250 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Best Presentation</h5>
            <p>While the project is important, so is the presentation. Why not ditch the slide deck for something with a bit more pizzazz, and win yourself $250?
            </p>

            <h5>$250 - Most Masochistic</h5>
            <p>The project that caused the most pain for its creators will earn them $250. It's not enough to make up for a weekend of self-inflicted misery, but it helps.
            </p>

            <h4>Rules</h4>
            <p>There are a few rules you'll need to follow to be eligible for prizes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Teams must use some form of version control, in a new repository. If your project doesn't lend itself to being managed by version control (e.g. hardware), case-by-case considerations might be made.</li>
                    <li>Projects cannot be started early.</li>
                    <li>Teams must consist of <i>current</i> students from a university in Queensland, and team members must be UQCS members (you can join right <a href="https://join.uqcs.org" target="_blank">here</a> on the UQCS website!).</li>
                    <li>Prize winners must be uploaded to the UQCS Showcase before payout.</li>
                </ul>
            If your team isn't eligible to win prizes, you are still welcome to come along and participate!
