UQCS Hackathon 2022 is here!! Featuring prizes bigger and better than ever, SEVEN free meals, and 24 hour stay (TBD)! That's right - you'll be able to stay at uni overnight to get that authentic hackathon experience (TM).</p><p>Any year and experience level is welcome! In the past, students have built websites, desktop apps, games, hardware, and even robots and if you've never been to a hackathon before, not to worry - we'll be hosting a talk before hackathon weekend to walk you through and give you tips and tricks for your first hackathon experience.</p><p><b>EARLY BIRD TICKETS</b>: student tickets will only be $10 if you purchase one <b>on or before 5th Aug</b>, or only $15 with a <i>limited edition laptop blahaj</i> shirt included! Other ticket types can be found at the Humanitix event link above.</p><h3>Projects</h3><p>Some past projects are on our showcase page.</p><p><a class=button href=/showcase/>UQCS Showcase</a></p><h3>Pricing</h3><p>Early bird student tickets are just $10 (or $15 including a limited edition t-shirt). Otherwise, tickets are $15 for students and $20 for non-students (non-students are not eligible for prizes). As usual, we
will be supplying breakfast, lunch and dinner during the Hackathon too - make sure to grab your tickets so we can know how many people to cater for. See you there!</p><h3>Prizes</h3><p>We'll have <b>$5500</b> in prizes up for grabs across ten categories:</p><h5>$2000 - Best Overall</h5><p>The creators of the best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home a whopping $2000
dollars (not to mention bragging rights)! This prize is proudly sponsored by TechnologyOne.</p><h5>$1000 - Best Overall Runner Up</h5><p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $1000!</p><h5>$500 - Best First-Years</h5><p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $500 to distribute between themselves.<br>Note: for any ambiguous cases, the executive committee will determine team eligibility for this prize on presentation day.</p><h5>$500 - People's Choice</h5><p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite project, the project with the most votes will take home 500 big ones.</p><h5>$250 - Best Interdisciplinary Project</h5><p>UQCS likes to mix things up. The best project demonstrating skills or solving problems from other disciplines (hardware, science, math, and dare we say it... humanities) will be awarded $250 cash.</p><h5>$250 - Best Design</h5><p>The creator(s) of the project demonstrating the coolest visual design will take home their choice of $250 to spend on turtlenecks or a pirated PDF copy of Banksy's art book Wall and Piece.</p><h5>$250 - Best Game</h5><p>Be it a game or a gaming related project there's $250 in it for the gamers as well. May the brightest mechanical keyboard win!</p><h5>$250 - Best Community Project</h5><p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic or community organisation, or addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $250 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).</p><h5>$250 - Best Presentation</h5><p>While the project is important, so is the presentation. Why not ditch the slide deck for something with a bit more pizzazz, and win yourself $250?</p><h5>$250 - Most Masochistic</h5><p>The project that caused the most pain for its creators will earn them $250. It's not enough to make up for a weekend of self-inflicted misery, but it helps.</p><h4>Rules</h4><p>There are a few rules you'll need to follow to be eligible for prizes:<ul><li>Teams must use some form of version control, in a new repository.</li><li>Projects cannot be started early.</li><li>Teams must consist of <i>current</i> students from a university in Queensland, and team members must be UQCS members (you can join right <a href=https://join.uqcs.org target=_blank>here</a> on the UQCS website!).</li><li>Prize winners must be uploaded to the UQCS Showcase before payout.</li></ul>If your team isn't eligible to win prizes, you are still welcome to come along and participate!</p></div></section></div></div><footer class="footer uqcs-background is-dark"><div class="has-text-white footer-info columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8-desktop is-10-tablet"><div class=level><div class=level-left><div class=level-item><div><img src=/img/logo/logo-long-white.svg alt="UQ Computing Society Logo" class=image style=display:block;height:100px;width:256px><div class=mt-2>&copy; UQ Computing Society 2022</div><div>👋 Hello from Brisbane/Meanjin</div></div></div></div><div class="level-right is-hidden-mobile"><div class=level-item><ul><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/about>About</a></li><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/events>Events</a></li><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/connect>Connect</a></li><li class=footer-link><a class=text-white href=/showcase>Showcase</a></li></ul></div><div class="level-item pl-6"><ul><li class=footer-link><a href=https://join.uqcs.org>Join UQCS</a></li><li class=footer-link><a href=https://discord.uqcs.org>Discord</a></li><li class=footer-link><a href=https://github.com/uqcomputingsociety/design>Design
