You get a list of questions to solve varying in difficulty, with harder questions gaining more points. The questions use knowledge from a wide range of fields but all can be solved with the help of code.
It’s a fun challenge to get experience in these styles of questions, which are often asked by employers in technical interviews.</description></item></channel></rss>
