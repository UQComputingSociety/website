title: Python Library Lightning Talks
---

Our first set of lightning talks for the year went incredibly well. We saw plenty of new faces and even had a few people sign up on the day. You can find video and slides from the event after the break.

## The Talks

Thanks everyone for coming along, it was great to see so many new attendees. I'd also like to thank our speakers: Mitch Grice, Lewis Bobberman and Nicholas Lambourne.

We covered a wide range of Python libraries, both from the standard library and from PyPI:

- JSON
- Requests
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Logging
- Jupyter Notebooks

If you couldn't make it on the day or just want to relive the experience, we were lucky enough to be able to get a recording which I've embedded below.

As promised, we have also included the slides themselves in the Resources section below. There are also some great suggestions for other Python libraries to check out.
