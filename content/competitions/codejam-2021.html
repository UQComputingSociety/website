        <div class="content">

            <p>The UQCS CodeJam is an individual competitive programming competition hosted each year to put students'
                programming and problem solving abilities to the test. You'll be given a list of questions to solve,
                varying in difficulty, with solutions to harder questions earning more points and the highest scoring
                competitors taking home some sweet prizes. The questions use knowledge from a wide range of fields but
                all can be solved with the help of code.
            </p>
            <p>It’s a fun challenge to get experience in these styles of questions, which are often asked by employers
                in technical interviews. This year CodeJam is being supported by
                <a href="https://www.imc.com/ap/">IMC</a>, one of the world's most active proprietary
                trading firms and a key market maker in various products listed on exchanges
                throughout the world. They'll help support your journey and also provide you with
                some amazing networking opportunities!
            </p>
            <p>Keep reading to find out more about the competition and what to expect. If you have any questions, reach
                out on the <a href="https://fb.me/e/42v91HFQA">Facebook event page</a> or via our

            </p>

            <h3>So, how does it all work?</h3>
            <p>The CodeJam is programming competition hosted online through
                <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>. You can code in virtually any language (see
                <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/environment">competition environment</a>).
                Once you’ve written your code, it’s executed online against a number of test cases. </p>
            <p>Tests will cover basic scenarios as well as larger and more complex cases, to ensure your algorithm is
                efficient and reliable. Points are awarded for the number of tests you pass and the question’s
                difficulty.</p>
            <p>There will be a leaderboard of competitors based on points scored. The top scorers will earn prizes!</p>

            <h3>How can I prepare?</h3>
            <p>You'll need a HackerRank account to compete, you can sign up
